		<div> A user can select different features such as a certain data_type, time period, device and/or parameters when on EnviroHub.com. This sends an HTTP GET request to the server which then retrieves the data from the database and returns it to be displayed. </div>

		<div> The first part of the solution is to use digital signatures to ensure integrity and authenticity of the request. Each message is “signed” with the device’s private key given to it by EnviroHub.com. The signature should be generated using AES-128 bit encryption.  The Signing the message ensures non-repudiation meaning that the server knows where the message is coming from and there is no question who is sending the message; only the server and the particular device know the shared key.</div>
		<div> The second part of the solution is to use a symmetric shared secret key. There will be a unique secret key for every device that a user owns and each message will be encrypted on one side and decrypted on the other side using the same shared private key.  Data should be encrypted using RSA-SHA256.</div>
		<div> Encryption should be enabled in the server configuration file if you wish to support encrypted POST requests.</div>
		<div> Data posts should be sent to the following URL</div>
		<div> &ltserver address&gt/data/newData</div>
		<div> If making an unencrypted post, include any desired parameters JSON format in the post request.</div>
		<div> If making an encrypted post, these 3 parameters should be included in the post: device_id, signedData, unsignedData</div>
