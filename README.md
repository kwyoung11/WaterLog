3. Integration of these data with those of other sources (maps, weather, etc)
4. Visualization of events and properties over time.

# Features
1. Wireless communication from Device to Server via HTTP (with support for encryption and signing/verification)
2. Bulk Upload of SD Card data
3. Mobile input form for uploading data manually in the field
4. Map and Graph Displays
5. Integrated data from other sources (e.g. NOAA, USGS Water Service)
6. Software can be installed on private/personal linux servers via installation script
